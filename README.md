This was supposed to be a nightlife coordination app but I don't drink, or leave my house after dark, so it's this instead.

### User stories:

* As an unauthenticated user, I can view all parks in my area.

* As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a park to indicate I am going there today.

* As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a park if I no longer want to go there.

* As an unauthenticated user, when I log in I should not have to search again.
